arrays
    elements are adjacent in memory
    [] has constant time lookup.
    size must be known at compile time
    no warning if you go off the end
vector
    elements are adjacent in memory
    [] has constant time lookup.
    size is dynamic at runtime
    can go off the end with [], but not with .at()
    can do push_back, no push_front
list - doubly-linked list
    elements are NOT adjacent in memory
    does not have constant time lookup for random location
    constant time for FIRST and LAST elements.
    push_back, push_front
    pop_back, pop_front
queue - Line bank, grocery store. - FIFO
    enqueue()
    dequeue()
    does not have [] access
    linked-list
dequeue - Doubly-ended queue - double-linked list.

map - key/value pair storage system
    key can be any typed-thing (has to implement ==)
    ("bob", 4.5)
    ("greg", 9.3)
    keys must be unique
    count - 0/1
set - group of numbers, with NO REPEATS, order is not important
    insert
    erase
    count - 0/1
bag - group of numbers, REPEATS ok, order is not important
    insert
    erase
    count - 0,1,2.....
